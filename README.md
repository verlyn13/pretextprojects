## Docker Workflow for PreTeXt Projects

This workflow allows you to run the Docker container in the background, enabling you to continue using your terminal for other tasks. You can attach a terminal session to the running container as needed for PreTeXt CLI commands or other tasks.

### Starting the Container in Detached Mode

Start the Docker container in detached mode with the following command:

```
bash
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 8128:8128 --cpus="1.0" --memory="4g" -v ${PWD}:/home/jupyter --name pretext_project verlyn13/pretext-image:latest ```

### Attaching a Terminal Session to the Running Container

To attach an interactive terminal session to the running container:
```
docker exec -it pretext_project /bin/bash```

### Viewing PreTeXt Build (Web)

To serve the PreTeXt project and view it in your browser:
```
bash
pretext view --access public ```

The web page will then be available at http://localhost:8128/output/web/.
